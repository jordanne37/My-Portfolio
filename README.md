# 02 Advanced CSS: Portfolio

## Your Task
Create a portfolio to showcase all my work and projects I will created during my time in the bootcamp. Make sure I include a section about myself, my work and my contact information. Make sure all links work and that I use placeholder images becasue I dont have enough work. 
 


## User Story

```
AS A STUDENT
I WANT to show future employers my work and deployed websites using my portfolio
SO THAT they can review samples of my work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
```


## Acceptance Criteria

Here are the critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring managerâ€™s needs:

```
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
```
